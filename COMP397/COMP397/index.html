                    You wake up on a bed, in a dark room. As you gradually get up, your eyes slowly adjust to the darkness. You can’t seem to recall your your name, where you are, and how you got here.

                </p>
                <p>Do you get up off the bed and try to find some clues, or go back to bed?</p>

                <p>
                    In the darkness, you feel around the room. You find a light switch and turn it on; As the lights turn on, you shield your eyes from the blinding light. You quickly notice a large object covered by a sheet. Before removing the sheet, you look around, noticing a door. 
                </p>
                <p>Do you investigate and remove the sheet, or choose to exit the room?</p>

                    As you remove the sheet, you notice it is a machinery object with some dials, numbers that seemed to be represented in a date format. As you investigate the machine further, you discover a number pad. You come to the conclusion that the machine is infact a Time Machine. You are mind-blown. You decide to input some numbers into the number pad.
                </p>
                <p>Do you choose to go to the ancient past, or the leading future?</p>

                    You decide to travel into the past. As the doors close in the machine, you get a churning, sick feeling in your stomach, and your knees weaken. You pass out... As you start to regain conscious, you slowly get up from the floor of the Time machine and open the doors shakily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You suddenly hear loud roars and screeches; you realize the Time Machine has brought you back to the Jurassic Age. While walking away from the Time Machine, you look around, and finally, into the sky. A falling meteor is hurling straight towards you.

                <p>
                    You stumble out of the Time Machine, looking around in awe. You wonder how far into the future you have travelled. While you looked around, you notice flying cars zooming by. Everything has futuristic look, and you are captivated by its baffling aspects.

                    You decide to leave the room, and as you are walking down the hallway, you notice a corridor to the left. You decide to take it, rather than go back to the room. You take the left turn, and soon after there is another left turn… After a few minutes of walking and turning, and many, many more left turns, you realize you’re lost…

                    You wake up, but notice you are not on the bed, nor even in the same room. You look around and all you see is… emptiness. No floors, no walls, nothing. You hear someone yell “Hey!” behind you, and you quickly turn around. You see a spirit, it offers you knowledge on the ‘truth’.

                    You ignore the spirit and continue to explore this mystifying place. You hear a “Hey!” behind you again, but in a deeper voice. You turn around. The same spirit flies towards and goes through you. Feeling weak, you collapse on the floor.
