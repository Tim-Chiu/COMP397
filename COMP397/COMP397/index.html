                    You wake up on a bed, in a dark room. As you slowly get up from the bed, 
                    your eyes slowly adjust to the darkness. You can’t seem remember your name, 
                    who you are, where you are, and how you got here.
                </p>
                <p>Do you get up off the bed, and try to find some clues, or ignore everything, and go back to bed?</p>

                    As your eyes slowly adjust to the darkness of the room, you feel around, 
                    you find a light switch, and turn it on, as the lights turn on you shield 
                    your eyes from the bright light. You quickly notice a large object covered 
                    by a sheet. Before you removed the sheet you look around, and notice a door.
                </p>

                    As you remove the sheet, and investigate the object, you noticed it is a 
                    machinery with some dials, with numbers seemly representing in a date format. 
                    As you investigate the machine more, you find a number pad. You come to the 
                    conclusion that the machine is infact a Time machine. as you input some numbers 
                    into the number pad.

                    You stumble out of the Time Machine, as you look around in awe, and wonder how far
